# Instructions

In order to run this code, init.ck need to be run first to add public classes to the virtual machine's namespace. After that hw2.ck can be modified and launched freely.

The code is a bit of a mess, but the "score" is at the bottom of hw2.ck. In the end I just commented out the parts of the score that I didn't need, output sections to wav files, and then arranged things in a daw to get the final output (found here https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~nshaheed/220b/hw2/).
